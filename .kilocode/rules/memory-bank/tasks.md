## Legacy Task Workflows (Reference Only)

All major system implementation tasks have been completed. The following workflows are preserved for reference in case new systems need to be added in the future:
**Last performed:** December 2024 - Issue #49
**Files to modify:**
- `/src/data/locations.ts` - Add utility functions for data lookups
- `/src/components/world/ActivitiesPanel.tsx` - Fix shopkeeper and item displays
- `/src/components/world/ShopModal.tsx` - Fix shopkeeper displays
- `/src/components/quest/QuestDialog.tsx` - Fix NPC displays
- `/src/components/quest/QuestDetails.tsx` - Fix quest giver displays
- `/tests/data/locations.test.ts` - Add tests for new utility functions

**Steps:**
1. Identify all instances where IDs are displayed instead of names using grep/search
2. Create utility functions (`getNpcById`, etc.) in data files for proper lookups
3. Update UI components to use these utilities instead of displaying raw IDs
4. Handle TypeScript type safety (optional fields, null checks)
5. Fix linting issues (case block declarations, prettier formatting)
6. Write comprehensive unit tests for new utility functions
7. Verify all tests pass and linting is clean

**Important notes:**
- Look for patterns like `{shop.keeper}`, `{reward.id}`, `{quest.npcId}` in components
- Use existing utilities like `getItemById()` as examples
- Ensure proper fallbacks for undefined values (e.g., `item?.name || itemId`)
- Wrap case statements with braces to avoid variable declaration errors
- Test edge cases like empty strings and invalid IDs

**Testing commands:**
```bash
bun run typecheck  # Ensure TypeScript compilation
bun run lint       # Check code style and rules
bun test           # Run full test suite
bun run build      # Verify production build
```

All major game systems follow this established pattern:

### System Implementation Workflow
**Files to create/modify:**
- `src/systems/[SystemName].ts` - Core system logic with static methods
- `src/types/[SystemName].ts` - TypeScript interfaces and constants
- `src/hooks/use[SystemName].ts` - React hook for UI integration (if needed)
- `src/components/[system]/` - UI components directory
- `src/data/[system].ts` - Static data definitions
- `tests/systems/[SystemName].test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests (30+ cases)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Design Phase**: Define comprehensive requirements from project brief
2. **Core System**: Implement main system class with static methods for all operations
3. **Type Safety**: Create complete TypeScript interfaces with strict typing
4. **Integration**: Update existing systems (GameLoop, useGameState) for integration
5. **Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality and edge cases
6. **Validation**: Ensure all tests pass, TypeScript compiles, and production builds

**Key Principles:**
- Use static class methods for stateless operations
- Implement Result<T> pattern for operation results with proper error handling
- Integrate with GameLoop for tick-based progression where applicable
- Aim for 50+ test cases per major system
- Follow existing UI component patterns (shadcn/ui, game interface architecture)
