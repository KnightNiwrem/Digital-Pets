# Digital Pets - Current Context

## Current Project State
The project is currently in **initial setup phase** with a Bun + React template configured but no pet game functionality implemented.

### What Exists
- Basic Bun + React project structure with TypeScript
- UI component library (shadcn/ui) with TailwindCSS styling
- Build system configured with custom `build.ts` script
- Template [`App.tsx`](src/App.tsx) with placeholder content and API testing component
- Development tooling: Hot reload, TypeScript path aliases (`@/*` -> `src/*`)
- Project structure with `src/` directory containing React entry points

### What's Missing
- **Core Game Systems**: No pet, game mechanics, or world systems implemented
- **Game UI**: No pet care interface, world exploration, or battle screens
- **Data Models**: No TypeScript interfaces for pets, items, locations, or game state
- **Storage System**: Web Storage API integration for save/load functionality
- **Game Loop**: 15-second tick system and offline progression calculation
- **Content**: No pets, items, locations, NPCs, or quests defined

## Current Work Focus
**Phase 1: Foundation Development**
- Need to replace template content with actual pet game
- Implement core game architecture and data models
- Create the foundational game systems before building UI

## Recent Changes
- Memory Bank initialized with comprehensive project analysis
- Product vision and technical requirements documented

## Next Steps
1. **Architecture Design**: Define system architecture and component relationships
2. **Core Systems**: Implement pet system, game mechanics, and world structure
3. **Data Models**: Create TypeScript interfaces for all game entities
4. **Storage Layer**: Implement Web Storage API for game persistence
5. **Game Loop**: Build the 15-second tick system with offline progression
6. **UI Development**: Create game screens and user interface
7. **Content Creation**: Define pets, items, locations, and NPCs

## Blockers & Dependencies
- None currently identified
- Project is ready for development to begin

## Technology Decisions Made
- Using Bun runtime for development and building
- React 19 for UI framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for component library
- Web Storage API for persistence (as required by brief)
