- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with 29+ test files covering all major systems
- **Build Status**: Clean TypeScript compilation, linting passes, production builds successful

## Completed Systems
### Core Foundation
- [`PetSystem`](src/systems/PetSystem.ts) - Complete pet care mechanics with offline progression
- [`GameLoop`](src/engine/GameLoop.ts) - 15-second tick system with autosave
- [`GameStorage`](src/storage/GameStorage.ts) - Web Storage API integration with migration support

### Game Systems
- [`WorldSystem`](src/systems/WorldSystem.ts) - Location travel and activities with activity logging
- [`BattleSystem`](src/systems/BattleSystem.ts) - Turn-based combat with AI opponents
- [`ItemSystem`](src/systems/ItemSystem.ts) - Inventory management and item effects
- [`QuestSystem`](src/systems/QuestSystem.ts) - Quest management with progression tracking
- [`ActivityLogSystem`](src/systems/ActivityLogSystem.ts) - Activity history tracking

### User Interface
