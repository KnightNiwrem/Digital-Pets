# Digital Pets - Current Context

## Current Project State
The project has completed **Phase 1: Core Foundation** with the PetSystem fully implemented. This represents the critical P0 system and enables the core pet care gameplay loop.

### What Exists
- Basic Bun + React project structure with TypeScript
- UI component library (shadcn/ui) with TailwindCSS styling
- Build system configured with custom `build.ts` script
- **✅ PetSystem** (`src/systems/PetSystem.ts`): Complete pet care mechanics including:
  - Pet care actions (feed, drink, play, clean poop, medicine, sleep/wake)
  - Stat management with hidden tick counters
  - Health system (healthy, injured, sick states)
  - Life mechanics and growth system (50 stages)
  - Energy and poop systems
  - Status analysis and event prediction
- **✅ GameLoop Integration** (`src/engine/GameLoop.ts`): Updated to use PetSystem
- **✅ Comprehensive Unit Tests** (`tests/systems/PetSystem.test.ts`): 54 test cases with 110 expect() calls
- **✅ Core Type Definitions** (`src/types/*`): Pet, GameState, and related interfaces
- Development tooling: Hot reload, TypeScript path aliases (`@/*` -> `src/*`)

### What's In Progress
- **Storage System**: Basic GameStorage exists but needs full Web Storage API integration
- **GameStateFactory**: Foundation exists but needs completion

### What's Missing
- **Game UI**: No pet care interface, world exploration, or battle screens
- **Data Models**: Missing interfaces for items, locations, world entities  
- **World System**: Locations and travel mechanics not implemented
- **Battle System**: Turn-based combat not implemented
- **Content**: No pets, items, locations, NPCs, or quests defined

## Current Work Focus
**Phase 2: Storage & UI Foundation**
- Complete Web Storage API integration for save/load functionality
- Build basic pet care UI to enable gameplay testing
- Implement remaining core data models

## Recent Changes
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: PetSystem implemented with comprehensive testing
- GameLoop integrated with PetSystem replacing duplicate logic
- All 54 unit tests passing with full TypeScript compliance
- Production build successful with clean linting

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Storage System Completion**: Finish Web Storage API integration for save/load
2. **Basic Pet UI**: Create minimal pet care interface for testing
3. **Data Models**: Complete TypeScript interfaces for items, locations, world
4. **World System**: Implement locations and travel mechanics  
5. **Battle System**: Add turn-based combat
6. **Content Creation**: Define pets, items, locations, and NPCs
7. **Advanced UI**: Full game screens and user interface

## Blockers & Dependencies
- None currently identified
- Project is ready for development to begin

## Technology Decisions Made
- Using Bun runtime for development and building
- React 19 for UI framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for component library
- Web Storage API for persistence (as required by brief)
