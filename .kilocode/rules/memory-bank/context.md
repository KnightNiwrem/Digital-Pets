- **✅ Correct item labeling**: Proper stat names (Satiety/Hydration vs Hunger/Thirst)

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- **✅ DRY Code Patterns**: Extracted common validation and calculation logic
- **✅ Utility Classes**: PetValidator, GameMath, EnergyManager for code reuse
- **✅ Standardized Result Types**: Consistent error handling across systems
- **✅ Enhanced Testing**: 260 tests with comprehensive utility coverage

**Technical Features:**
- All 260 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- Production builds successful with clean linting
