- 12 battle moves across physical, special, and status categories

**User Interface Improvements:**
- **✅ Hidden internal values**: Life value no longer displayed to players
- **✅ Hidden timers**: Next poop time no longer shown to players
- **✅ Removed pause functionality**: Game cannot be paused (per feedback)
- **✅ Clean game stats**: Game ticks removed from footer display
- **✅ Correct item labeling**: Proper stat names (Satiety/Hydration vs Hunger/Thirst)

**Code Quality Improvements:**

- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for styling and components
- Web Storage API for persistence (as required by brief)
- Custom React hooks for game state management
- Component-based architecture for UI modularity
- Utility-based architecture for shared game logic (PetValidator, GameMath, EnergyManager)
- Enhanced autosave utility for immediate saves after user actions
