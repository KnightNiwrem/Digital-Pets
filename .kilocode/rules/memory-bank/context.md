### What's Working
**Core Game Features:**
- Pet care actions: Feed, Water, Play, Sleep/Wake, Medicine, Clean
- Real-time stat tracking with visual progress bars (Satiety, Hydration, Happiness, Energy)
- Health system with treatment mechanics
- Automatic game loop with 15-second tick progression
- Offline progression calculation (up to 7 days catch-up)
- Complete save/load system with Web Storage API
- Manual save functionality (pause removed per feedback)

**World Exploration Features:**
- Location-based gameplay with 3 initial areas (Hometown, Forest Path, Riverside)
- Travel system with energy costs and level requirements
- Activity system (foraging, fishing, training) with duration and rewards
- Real-time progress tracking for travel and activities
- Offline progression for world activities
- Tabbed interface switching between Pet Care, World Exploration, and Inventory

**Inventory Management Features:**
- Complete inventory system with grid-based interface (8x6 = 48 slots)
- Item categorization and filtering (All, Food, Drinks, Medicine, Toys, Equipment)
- Item usage with validation and pet state integration
- Item selling with quantity controls and dynamic pricing
- Inventory sorting by name, value, rarity, type, or quantity
- Visual rarity indicators and durability warnings
- Comprehensive item effects system (satiety, hydration, happiness, energy, health, cleaning)
- Starting inventory with 5 essential item types
- **✅ Corrected item labeling**: Food shows "+X Satiety", Drinks show "+X Hydration"

**Battle System Features:**
- Complete turn-based combat system with move execution
- AI opponent action generation and strategy
- Status effects and stat modification system
- Critical hit mechanics and accuracy calculations
- Battle rewards system (experience, gold, items)
- 12 battle moves across physical, special, and status categories

**User Interface Improvements:**
- **✅ Hidden internal values**: Life value no longer displayed to players
- **✅ Hidden timers**: Next poop time no longer shown to players
- **✅ Removed pause functionality**: Game cannot be paused (per feedback)
- **✅ Clean game stats**: Game ticks removed from footer display
- **✅ Correct item labeling**: Proper stat names (Satiety/Hydration vs Hunger/Thirst)

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- **✅ DRY Code Patterns**: Extracted common validation and calculation logic
- **✅ Utility Classes**: PetValidator, GameMath, EnergyManager for code reuse
- **✅ Standardized Result Types**: Consistent error handling across systems
- **✅ Enhanced Testing**: 260 tests with comprehensive utility coverage

**Technical Features:**
- All 260 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- Production builds successful with clean linting
- Responsive UI design with intuitive controls
- Type-safe codebase with no any/unknown types
- Error handling with user feedback
- Automatic state synchronization between game logic and UI

### What's Missing
- **Advanced Features**: Quest system, achievements, training facilities
- **Content**: Limited pets, items, locations, NPCs, or quests defined (foundation exists)
- **Battle UI**: Backend complete, but no user interface components yet

## Current Work Focus
**✅ MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED: Code Refactoring and DRY Improvements**

Successfully completed comprehensive codebase refactoring with significant improvements:

**Result Type Standardization:**
- ✅ Removed duplicate Result type definitions from ItemSystem.ts and WorldSystem.ts
- ✅ Standardized on shared Result type from types/index.ts across all systems
- ✅ Added message field to Result type for enhanced error reporting

**Pet State Validation Patterns:**
- ✅ Extracted PetValidator utility class with 8 reusable validation methods
- ✅ Replaced 15+ duplicate pet state checks across 4 systems
- ✅ Standardized error messages for common validation failures
- ✅ Enhanced type safety and maintainability

**Game Math Utilities:**
- ✅ Created GameMath utility class with 15 mathematical helper functions
- ✅ Consolidated tick-to-display conversion logic throughout PetSystem
- ✅ Extracted common calculations for damage, accuracy, stat management
- ✅ Improved code reusability across battle and pet care systems

**Energy Management Utilities:**
- ✅ Created EnergyManager utility class for consistent energy handling
- ✅ Standardized energy cost validation and deduction across systems
- ✅ Unified energy-related error messages for better UX consistency
- ✅ Simplified energy management logic in Pet, World, and Battle systems

**Enhanced Testing Coverage:**
- ✅ Added 77 new unit tests for utility functions
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for PetValidator (30 tests)
- ✅ Complete test suite for GameMath calculations (33 tests)
- ✅ Full test coverage for EnergyManager functionality (14 tests)
- ✅ Improved overall test count from 183 to 260 tests

## Recent Changes

2. **Shop Integration**: Implement shopping/trading NPCs in world locations using ItemSystem
3. **Battle UI Components**: User interface for the battle system
4. **Advanced Features**: Quest system, achievements, training facilities
5. **Polish & Optimization**: Performance improvements and additional features

## Blockers & Dependencies
- None currently identified
- Strong foundation is in place for all future development
- All core systems (Pet, Storage, GameLoop, UI) are fully functional
- User feedback has been successfully addressed
- Code quality improvements completed with enhanced maintainability

## Technology Decisions Made
- Using Bun runtime for development and building
- React 19 for UI framework
- TypeScript for type safety (strict mode, no any/unknown)
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for styling and components
- Web Storage API for persistence (as required by brief)
- Custom React hooks for game state management
- Component-based architecture for UI modularity
- Utility-based architecture for shared game logic (PetValidator, GameMath, EnergyManager)
