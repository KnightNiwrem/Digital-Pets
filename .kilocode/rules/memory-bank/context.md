# Digital Pets - Current Context

## Current Project State
The project has completed **Phase 2: Storage & UI Foundation** with a fully functional pet care game! The core gameplay loop is now working with comprehensive save/load functionality and a polished React-based user interface.

**✅ MAJOR MILESTONE**: Phase 3 WorldSystem implementation is now complete and functional!

### What Exists
- Basic Bun + React project structure with TypeScript
- UI component library (shadcn/ui) with TailwindCSS styling
- Build system configured with custom `build.ts` script
- **✅ PetSystem** (`src/systems/PetSystem.ts`): Complete pet care mechanics
- **✅ GameLoop Integration** (`src/engine/GameLoop.ts`): Updated with offline progression calculation
- **✅ Storage System** (`src/storage/GameStorage.ts`): Complete Web Storage API integration
- **✅ Comprehensive Unit Tests**: 95 tests passing (54 PetSystem + 28 WorldSystem + 13 GameLoop)
- **✅ Pet Care UI Components** (`src/components/pet/`): PetDisplay and PetCarePanel
- **✅ Game State Management** (`src/hooks/useGameState.ts`): Complete React hook for game interactions
- **✅ Main Game Interface** (`src/components/GameScreen.tsx`): Fully functional game UI with tabbed interface
- **✅ WorldSystem** (`src/systems/WorldSystem.ts`): Complete location management and activity system
- **✅ World UI Components** (`src/components/world/`): WorldMap, ActivitiesPanel, and WorldScreen
- **✅ Location & Item Data** (`src/data/`): 3 locations, 12 items with complete definitions
- Development tooling: Hot reload, TypeScript path aliases (`@/*` -> `src/*`)

### What's Working
**Core Game Features:**
- Pet care actions: Feed, Water, Play, Sleep/Wake, Medicine, Clean
- Real-time stat tracking with visual progress bars (Hunger, Thirst, Happiness, Energy)
- Health system with treatment mechanics
- Automatic game loop with 15-second tick progression
- Offline progression calculation (up to 7 days catch-up)
- Complete save/load system with Web Storage API
- Game pause/resume and manual save functionality

**World Exploration Features:**
- Location-based gameplay with 3 initial areas (Hometown, Forest Path, Riverside)
- Travel system with energy costs and level requirements
- Activity system (foraging, fishing, training) with duration and rewards
- Real-time progress tracking for travel and activities
- Offline progression for world activities
- Tabbed interface switching between Pet Care and World Exploration

**Technical Features:**
- All 95 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- Production builds successful with clean linting
- Responsive UI design with intuitive controls
- Type-safe codebase with no any/unknown types
- Error handling with user feedback
- Automatic state synchronization between game logic and UI

### What's Missing
- **Item System**: Basic item types exist but no inventory management UI
- **Advanced Features**: Quest system, achievements, training facilities
- **Content**: Limited pets, items, locations, NPCs, or quests defined

## Current Work Focus
**Completed Phase 3: World & Battle Systems (BOTH COMPLETE)**

With both the WorldSystem and BattleSystem now fully implemented and tested, Phase 3 is complete! The project now has a comprehensive battle system with turn-based combat mechanics alongside the existing world exploration system.

## Recent Changes
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: BattleSystem implementation completed
- Complete turn-based combat system with move execution
- 30 comprehensive BattleSystem unit tests (125 total tests now passing)
- Battle initialization, action processing, and result application
- Move data definitions with 12 different battle moves
- AI opponent action generation
- Status effects and stat modification system
- Critical hit mechanics and accuracy calculations
- Battle rewards system (experience, gold, items)
- All code passes linting and builds successfully

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Item System UI**: Inventory management interface and item usage
2. **Content Creation**: Define more pets, items, locations, NPCs, and quests  
3. **Battle UI Components**: User interface for the battle system
4. **Advanced Features**: Quest system, achievements, training facilities
5. **Polish & Optimization**: Performance improvements and additional features

## Blockers & Dependencies
- None currently identified
- Strong foundation is in place for all future development
- All core systems (Pet, Storage, GameLoop, UI) are fully functional

## Technology Decisions Made
- Using Bun runtime for development and building
- React 19 for UI framework
- TypeScript for type safety (strict mode, no any/unknown)
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for styling and components
- Web Storage API for persistence (as required by brief)
- Custom React hooks for game state management
- Component-based architecture for UI modularity
