# Digital Pets - Current Context

## Current Project State
The project has completed **Phase 2: Storage & UI Foundation** with a fully functional pet care game! The core gameplay loop is now working with comprehensive save/load functionality and a polished React-based user interface.

**✅ MAJOR MILESTONE**: Phase 3 WorldSystem implementation is now complete and functional!

**✅ COMPLETED**: UI/UX Feedback Implementation - All user interface issues have been addressed per feedback requirements.

**✅ COMPLETED**: Code Refactoring and DRY Improvements - Major codebase simplification and utility extraction completed.

### What Exists

- **✅ Utility Classes** (`src/lib/utils.ts`): PetValidator, GameMath, and EnergyManager for DRY code patterns
- Development tooling: Hot reload, TypeScript path aliases (`@/*` -> `src/*`)

### What's Working
**Core Game Features:**
- Pet care actions: Feed, Water, Play, Sleep/Wake, Medicine, Clean
- Real-time stat tracking with visual progress bars (Satiety, Hydration, Happiness, Energy)
- Health system with treatment mechanics
- Automatic game loop with 15-second tick progression
- Offline progression calculation (up to 7 days catch-up)
- Complete save/load system with Web Storage API
- Manual save functionality (pause removed per feedback)

**World Exploration Features:**
- Location-based gameplay with 3 initial areas (Hometown, Forest Path, Riverside)
- Travel system with energy costs and level requirements
- Activity system (foraging, fishing, training) with duration and rewards
- Real-time progress tracking for travel and activities
- Offline progression for world activities
- Tabbed interface switching between Pet Care, World Exploration, and Inventory

**Inventory Management Features:**
- Complete inventory system with grid-based interface (8x6 = 48 slots)
- Item categorization and filtering (All, Food, Drinks, Medicine, Toys, Equipment)
- Item usage with validation and pet state integration
- Item selling with quantity controls and dynamic pricing
- Inventory sorting by name, value, rarity, type, or quantity
- Visual rarity indicators and durability warnings
- Comprehensive item effects system (satiety, hydration, happiness, energy, health, cleaning)
- Starting inventory with 5 essential item types
- **✅ Corrected item labeling**: Food shows "+X Satiety", Drinks show "+X Hydration"

**Battle System Features:**
- Complete turn-based combat system with move execution
- AI opponent action generation and strategy
- Status effects and stat modification system
- Critical hit mechanics and accuracy calculations
- Battle rewards system (experience, gold, items)
- 12 battle moves across physical, special, and status categories

**User Interface Improvements:**
- **✅ Hidden internal values**: Life value no longer displayed to players
- **✅ Hidden timers**: Next poop time no longer shown to players
- **✅ Removed pause functionality**: Game cannot be paused (per feedback)
- **✅ Clean game stats**: Game ticks removed from footer display
- **✅ Correct item labeling**: Proper stat names (Satiety/Hydration vs Hunger/Thirst)

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- **✅ DRY Code Patterns**: Extracted common validation and calculation logic
- **✅ Utility Classes**: PetValidator, GameMath, EnergyManager for code reuse
- **✅ Standardized Result Types**: Consistent error handling across systems
- **✅ Enhanced Testing**: 260 tests with comprehensive utility coverage

**Technical Features:**
- All 260 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- Production builds successful with clean linting
- Responsive UI design with intuitive controls
- Type-safe codebase with no any/unknown types
- Error handling with user feedback
- Automatic state synchronization between game logic and UI

### What's Missing
- **Advanced Features**: Quest system, achievements, training facilities
- **Content**: Limited pets, items, locations, NPCs, or quests defined (foundation exists)
- **Battle UI**: Backend complete, but no user interface components yet

## Current Work Focus
**✅ MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED: Shop Integration Implementation**

Successfully implemented comprehensive shop functionality with UI components and backend integration:

**Shop System Implementation:**
- ✅ Enhanced WorldSystem with shop methods (`getAvailableShops`, `getShopById`, `isShopAvailable`)
- ✅ Created ShopPanel component with buy/sell interface and item categorization
- ✅ Implemented ShopModal for immersive shopping experience
- ✅ Updated ActivitiesPanel to display available shops with interactive buttons
- ✅ Enhanced WorldScreen with shop modal integration and state management
- ✅ Updated GameScreen with shop handlers connecting to ItemSystem backend
- ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests (5 new shop tests, now 265 total tests passing)

**UI Components Created:**
- ✅ `src/components/world/ShopPanel.tsx` - Complete shop interface with buy/sell tabs
- ✅ `src/components/world/ShopModal.tsx` - Modal dialog for shop interactions
- ✅ `src/components/ui/badge.tsx` - Badge component for item rarity display
- ✅ `src/components/ui/separator.tsx` - UI separator component for layout

**Backend Integration:**
- ✅ Shop data already exists in locations (General Store with 4 items)
- ✅ ItemSystem.buyItem() and sellItem() methods integrated with UI
- ✅ Full error handling and validation throughout shop workflow
- ✅ Real-time inventory and gold updates during shop transactions

**Technical Features:**
- ✅ Full TypeScript compliance with strict typing

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Battle UI Components**: User interface for the complete battle system backend
2. **Content Expansion**: Define more pets, items, locations, NPCs, and quests
3. **Quest System Implementation**: Framework in place, need core logic and UI
4. **Advanced Features**: Achievements, training facilities, advanced NPCs
5. **Polish & Optimization**: Performance improvements and additional features

## Blockers & Dependencies
- None currently identified
- Strong foundation is in place for all future development
- All core systems (Pet, Storage, GameLoop, UI) are fully functional
- User feedback has been successfully addressed
- Code quality improvements completed with enhanced maintainability

## Technology Decisions Made
- Using Bun runtime for development and building
- React 19 for UI framework
- TypeScript for type safety (strict mode, no any/unknown)
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for styling and components
- Web Storage API for persistence (as required by brief)
- Custom React hooks for game state management
- Component-based architecture for UI modularity
- Utility-based architecture for shared game logic (PetValidator, GameMath, EnergyManager)
