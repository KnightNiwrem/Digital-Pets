- Item categorization and filtering (All, Food, Drinks, Medicine, Toys, Equipment)
- Item usage with validation and pet state integration
- Item selling with quantity controls and dynamic pricing
- Inventory sorting by name, value, rarity, type, or quantity
- Visual rarity indicators and durability warnings
- Comprehensive item effects system (satiety, hydration, happiness, energy, health, cleaning)
- Starting inventory with 5 essential item types
- **✅ Corrected item labeling**: Food shows "+X Satiety", Drinks show "+X Hydration"

**Enhanced Autosave Features:**
- **✅ Quest Actions**: startQuest, abandonQuest, completeQuest trigger immediate autosave
- **✅ Pet Care Actions**: feedPet, giveDrink, playWithPet, cleanPoop, treatPet, toggleSleep trigger autosave
- **✅ Inventory/Money Actions**: useItem, sellItem, buyItem, sortInventory trigger autosave  
- **✅ World Actions**: startTravel, startActivity, cancelActivity trigger autosave
- **✅ Battle Actions**: applyBattleResults triggers autosave when battle ends
- **✅ Error Handling**: Graceful handling of autosave failures with console warnings
- **✅ Autosave Logging**: Clear logging of what action triggered each autosave

**Battle System Features:**
- Complete turn-based combat system with move execution
- AI opponent action generation and strategy
- Status effects and stat modification system
- Critical hit mechanics and accuracy calculations
- Battle rewards system (experience, gold, items)
- 12 battle moves across physical, special, and status categories

**User Interface Improvements:**
- **✅ Hidden internal values**: Life value no longer displayed to players
- **✅ Hidden timers**: Next poop time no longer shown to players
- **✅ Removed pause functionality**: Game cannot be paused (per feedback)
- **✅ Clean game stats**: Game ticks removed from footer display
- **✅ Correct item labeling**: Proper stat names (Satiety/Hydration vs Hunger/Thirst)

**Code Quality Improvements:**

## Current Work Focus
**✅ MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED: Mobile UI Improvements**

Successfully implemented all requested mobile UI improvements that eliminate usability issues on mobile devices:

**Mobile UI Fixes Completed:**
- ✅ Changed "Pet Sleeping" button label to "Sleeping" in ActivitiesPanel.tsx for better mobile compatibility
- ✅ Updated "Pet Care" tab label to "Care" in GameScreen.tsx to save horizontal space  
- ✅ Converted horizontally scrollable page tabs to use flex-wrap for multiple rows instead of overflow
- ✅ Improved inventory filter layout with better spacing and flex-wrap for category buttons
- ✅ Enhanced ItemCategoryTabs with better mobile padding and responsive design

**Technical Achievements:**
- ✅ All changes maintain desktop functionality while improving mobile experience
- ✅ Tab navigation now wraps to multiple rows instead of requiring horizontal scrolling
- ✅ Inventory filters are no longer cramped and use available space efficiently
- ✅ Activity buttons display concise labels appropriate for mobile screen constraints
- ✅ All code passes linting and type checking with no errors
- ✅ Changes are minimal and surgical, maintaining existing functionality

**UI Components Enhanced:**
- ✅ **GameScreen.tsx**: Tab navigation with flex-wrap, shortened "Care" label
- ✅ **ActivitiesPanel.tsx**: Concise "Sleeping" button label instead of "Pet Sleeping"
- ✅ **InventoryScreen.tsx**: Better mobile layout with stacked filters and flex-wrap sorting
- ✅ **ItemCategoryTabs.tsx**: Improved mobile spacing and responsive design

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ **Before**: Tab navigation required horizontal scrolling, cramped filters, long button labels
- ✅ **After**: Clean multi-row layout, well-spaced filters, appropriate mobile labels
- ✅ Responsive design works smoothly across mobile (375px) to desktop (1920px)
- ✅ All functionality preserved while significantly improving mobile UX

## Recent Changes
- **✅ Fixed Incomplete Implementations**: Resolved 2 critical TODOs in codebase
  - **WorldSystem**: Implemented inventory checking for activity requirements with comprehensive testing
  - **GameLoop**: Implemented item reward distribution using ItemSystem with comprehensive testing  
- **✅ Enhanced Test Coverage**: Added 8 new focused unit tests (338 total tests passing)
  - 4 tests for inventory requirement validation in WorldSystem
  - 4 tests for item reward distribution in GameLoop
- **✅ Code Quality**: All implementations pass strict TypeScript checking and linting
- All existing tests continue to pass (330 baseline + 8 new = 338 tests)
- All code passes linting and builds successfully
- Both incomplete implementations now fully functional with proper error handling

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Content Expansion**: Define more pets, items, locations, NPCs, and quest chains
2. **Advanced Features**: Achievement system, training facilities, advanced quest features
3. **UI Polish**: Animations, notifications, enhanced user feedback for autosave
4. **Performance Optimization**: Autosave performance monitoring and optimization

## Blockers & Dependencies

- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for styling and components
- Web Storage API for persistence (as required by brief)
- Custom React hooks for game state management
- Component-based architecture for UI modularity
- Utility-based architecture for shared game logic (PetValidator, GameMath, EnergyManager)
- Enhanced autosave utility for immediate saves after user actions
