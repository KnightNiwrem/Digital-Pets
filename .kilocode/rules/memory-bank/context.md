# Digital Pets - Current Context

## Current Project State
The project has completed **Phase 2: Storage & UI Foundation** with a fully functional pet care game! The core gameplay loop is now working with comprehensive save/load functionality and a polished React-based user interface.

**✅ MAJOR MILESTONE**: Phase 3 WorldSystem implementation is now complete and functional!

**✅ COMPLETED**: UI/UX Feedback Implementation - All user interface issues have been addressed per feedback requirements.

### What Exists
- Basic Bun + React project structure with TypeScript
- UI component library (shadcn/ui) with TailwindCSS styling
- Build system configured with custom `build.ts` script
- **✅ PetSystem** (`src/systems/PetSystem.ts`): Complete pet care mechanics
- **✅ GameLoop Integration** (`src/engine/GameLoop.ts`): Updated with offline progression calculation
- **✅ Storage System** (`src/storage/GameStorage.ts`): Complete Web Storage API integration
- **✅ Comprehensive Unit Tests**: 183 tests passing (54 PetSystem + 28 WorldSystem + 30 BattleSystem + 58 ItemSystem + 13 GameLoop)
- **✅ Pet Care UI Components** (`src/components/pet/`): PetDisplay and PetCarePanel
- **✅ Game State Management** (`src/hooks/useGameState.ts`): Complete React hook for game and item interactions
- **✅ Main Game Interface** (`src/components/GameScreen.tsx`): Fully functional game UI with tabbed interface (Pet Care, World, Inventory)
- **✅ WorldSystem** (`src/systems/WorldSystem.ts`): Complete location management and activity system
- **✅ World UI Components** (`src/components/world/`): WorldMap, ActivitiesPanel, and WorldScreen
- **✅ BattleSystem** (`src/systems/BattleSystem.ts`): Complete turn-based combat system
- **✅ ItemSystem** (`src/systems/ItemSystem.ts`): Complete inventory management and item usage system
- **✅ Inventory UI Components** (`src/components/inventory/`): Complete inventory interface with grid, details, and categorization
- **✅ Location & Item Data** (`src/data/`): 3 locations, 12 items, 12 battle moves with complete definitions
- Development tooling: Hot reload, TypeScript path aliases (`@/*` -> `src/*`)

### What's Working
**Core Game Features:**
- Pet care actions: Feed, Water, Play, Sleep/Wake, Medicine, Clean
- Real-time stat tracking with visual progress bars (Satiety, Hydration, Happiness, Energy)
- Health system with treatment mechanics
- Automatic game loop with 15-second tick progression
- Offline progression calculation (up to 7 days catch-up)
- Complete save/load system with Web Storage API
- Manual save functionality (pause removed per feedback)

**World Exploration Features:**
- Location-based gameplay with 3 initial areas (Hometown, Forest Path, Riverside)
- Travel system with energy costs and level requirements
- Activity system (foraging, fishing, training) with duration and rewards
- Real-time progress tracking for travel and activities
- Offline progression for world activities
- Tabbed interface switching between Pet Care, World Exploration, and Inventory

**Inventory Management Features:**
- Complete inventory system with grid-based interface (8x6 = 48 slots)
- Item categorization and filtering (All, Food, Drinks, Medicine, Toys, Equipment)
- Item usage with validation and pet state integration
- Item selling with quantity controls and dynamic pricing
- Inventory sorting by name, value, rarity, type, or quantity
- Visual rarity indicators and durability warnings
- Comprehensive item effects system (satiety, hydration, happiness, energy, health, cleaning)
- Starting inventory with 5 essential item types
- **✅ Corrected item labeling**: Food shows "+X Satiety", Drinks show "+X Hydration"

**Battle System Features:**
- Complete turn-based combat system with move execution
- AI opponent action generation and strategy
- Status effects and stat modification system
- Critical hit mechanics and accuracy calculations
- Battle rewards system (experience, gold, items)
- 12 battle moves across physical, special, and status categories

**User Interface Improvements:**
- **✅ Hidden internal values**: Life value no longer displayed to players
- **✅ Hidden timers**: Next poop time no longer shown to players
- **✅ Removed pause functionality**: Game cannot be paused (per feedback)
- **✅ Clean game stats**: Game ticks removed from footer display
- **✅ Correct item labeling**: Proper stat names (Satiety/Hydration vs Hunger/Thirst)

**Technical Features:**
- All 183 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- Production builds successful with clean linting
- Responsive UI design with intuitive controls
- Type-safe codebase with no any/unknown types
- Error handling with user feedback
- Automatic state synchronization between game logic and UI

### What's Missing
- **Advanced Features**: Quest system, achievements, training facilities
- **Content**: Limited pets, items, locations, NPCs, or quests defined (foundation exists)
- **Battle UI**: Backend complete, but no user interface components yet

## Current Work Focus
**✅ MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED: UI/UX Feedback Implementation**

All user interface feedback issues have been successfully addressed:
- ✅ Removed Life value display (hidden internal mechanic)
- ✅ Removed next poop time display (hidden timer)
- ✅ Removed game ticks from footer (internal game mechanic)
- ✅ Removed pause button functionality (game cannot be paused)
- ✅ Fixed food item labeling: Shows "+X Satiety" instead of "+X Hunger"
- ✅ Fixed drink item labeling: Shows "+X Hydration" instead of "+X Thirst"

## Recent Changes
- **✅ UI/UX Feedback Implementation**: Completed comprehensive feedback addressing
- **✅ PetDisplay Component Updates**:
  - Removed Life value display (lines 144-147)
  - Removed Next Critical Event section (lines 162-170)
  - Cleaned up unused nextCriticalEvent variable
- **✅ GameScreen Component Updates**:
  - Removed pause button from header controls
  - Removed game ticks from footer display
  - Cleaned up unused pauseGame/resumeGame functions
- **✅ ItemDetailsPanel Component Updates**:
  - Changed satiety effect display from "+X Hunger" to "+X Satiety"
  - Changed hydration effect display from "+X Thirst" to "+X Hydration"
- **✅ Code Quality**: All linting, type checking, and formatting issues resolved
- All 183 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- All code passes linting and builds successfully

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Content Expansion**: Define more pets, items, locations, NPCs, and quests
2. **Shop Integration**: Implement shopping/trading NPCs in world locations using ItemSystem
3. **Battle UI Components**: User interface for the battle system
4. **Advanced Features**: Quest system, achievements, training facilities
5. **Polish & Optimization**: Performance improvements and additional features

## Blockers & Dependencies
- None currently identified
- Strong foundation is in place for all future development
- All core systems (Pet, Storage, GameLoop, UI) are fully functional
- User feedback has been successfully addressed

## Technology Decisions Made
- Using Bun runtime for development and building
- React 19 for UI framework
- TypeScript for type safety (strict mode, no any/unknown)
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for styling and components
- Web Storage API for persistence (as required by brief)
- Custom React hooks for game state management
- Component-based architecture for UI modularity
